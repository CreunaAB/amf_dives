## Ambition

Our ambition is to create an analytics team that is unrivaled by other digital agencies in the Nordics. We want to move away from the traditional view of “web analytics” as report factory into becoming closer to a business intelligence partner to our clients.

## Ideal Candidates

- Enthusiastic about new technologies.
- Explorative and unafraid of taking responsibility.
- Has no issue handling projects end-to-end single-handedly.
- Intermediate to expert level in a few key languages (see below).
- University student or in the industry for a few years.
- Has experience using open source technologies.
- Basic grasp of business fundamentals (accounting, corporate finance, biz dev).
- High engineering bent. Enjoys “building” things.
- Has experience automating routines and work on a regular basis.
- Basic grasp of dev ops routines (unit testing, continuous integration, git).

## Skillset

- Python (intermediate or advanced)
  - Pandas (required)
  - Scikit-learn
  - Keras
  - Matplotlib (required)
- R (optional)
  - Tidyverse
- SQL
- Dev Ops
  - Testing
  - Version control (git)
  - Reproducibility
- Mathematics (optional but a strong advantage)
  - Statistics
  - Bayesian Statistics
  - Operations Research
  - Business Calculus
  - Linear Algebra
  
> We can compromise on mathematics, candidates can learn this stuff on the job. However, we can’t skimp on the other skills.

## Experience

- Academic experience or industry experience.
- Minimum 2-3 years experience in either mentioned above.

## Current Needs

We want to keep the team small and nimble so that we can do more with less people. A smaller team also allows for smoother communication and more flexibility when updating and adopting our processes. 

Ideally, everyone in the team should have the same skillset. We want a team of generalists that can solve problems end-to-end. At this stage (starting from scratch), it’s more important for people to be able to handle all of the aspects of this work. This requires that everyone has a good grasp of all areas of data work—data analysis and data engineering—regardless of their title.

Our needs in the team are:

- **Data Engineer** (x1)
- **Data Analyst** (x1)

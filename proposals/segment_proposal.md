# What’s a Proposal

> Proposals are in-depth documents where you can provide a business case for analytics solutions (or tools) that you would like to implement. You can propose right about anything, however, it’s important that each proposal has a **Press Release** (a text that presents your solution in broad strokes as if we were to pitch it to clients), and a **Proof of Concept** (a toy model or example that shows how the solution words). The reason why is that we want to be able to quickly market a solution, and a template press release can help during pitches, and we want the solution to be viable—which requires you to, at least, prototype it.

## Press Release

> To help you outline your press release, think about addressing the following points:
> - What is the solution.
> - What problem does it solve for our client.
> - How long does it take to implement the solution.
> - Who is the beneficiacy (our client or our client’s customers).
> - How does the solution work in simple terms.
> - How valuable is this solution to the client (can you estimate savings or gains).
> - Why should we (Creuna) care about this solution.
> - Why should the client care about this solution.

Segment is a data management platform that allows you to tag (and send) data from and to a variety of tools in order to create a customer (or user) centric view of website users. It sits somewhere in between Heap and Panoply. You can think of Segment as a “universal tag manager”. With it you can create tracking plans and protocols and centralize the tracking of data across platforms from a single place.

- We can avoid having to setup tracking on multiple platforms independently.
- We can keep track of what data flows in in which platform and how to difine it.
- We can collect user-centric data that we can then send to a warehouse of our choice.
- (Hopefully) we get cleaner tracking management.

The highest tier before business custom pricing is $850 per month.

## Proof of Concept

> Your proof of concept can be more or less technical. It’s up to you if you want to go into the weeds and details of the solution you’re presenting. However, the most important factor is that **it MUST work**. In other words, although there are always bumpy roads ahead, the solution should work at least in its most elementary, barebones stage. We don’t want to pitch ideas that we can’t backup to clients. We don’t want to assume something’s going to work just to discover it doesn’t after we and the client have committed to it.

## Closing Remarks

> Here you can add any details, notes, and gotchas that you think the reader should be aware of. Write about things like edge cases, potential problems in the future, hiccups you stumbled upon when doing the proof of concept, and more.

I haven’t tried Segment yet. My hunch is that it could be used with clients who absolutely don’t want to give up the Google ecosystem. With Segment we could take ownership of tracking from a single source rather than having to mess with Google Tag Manager and other systems. We own the tracking protocols and we can switch tracking on and off as needed.

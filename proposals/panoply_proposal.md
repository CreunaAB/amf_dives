# What’s a Proposal

> Proposals are in-depth documents where you can provide a business case for analytics solutions (or tools) that you would like to implement. You can propose right about anything, however, it’s important that each proposal has a **Press Release** (a text that presents your solution in broad strokes as if we were to pitch it to clients), and a **Proof of Concept** (a toy model or example that shows how the solution words). The reason why is that we want to be able to quickly market a solution, and a template press release can help during pitches, and we want the solution to be viable—which requires you to, at least, prototype it.

## Press Release

> To help you outline your press release, think about addressing the following points:
> - What is the solution.
> - What problem does it solve for our client.
> - How long does it take to implement the solution.
> - Who is the beneficiacy (our client or our client’s customers).
> - How does the solution work in simple terms.
> - How valuable is this solution to the client (can you estimate savings or gains).
> - Why should we (Creuna) care about this solution.
> - Why should the client care about this solution.

Panoply allows you to combine a large variety of sources into one single data warehousing source and making that data available for visualization in other business intelligence tools.

The main justification for using Panoply is that it allows us to do a lot of what a data engineer would do (unifying data sources into a coherent data warehouse) automatically. Panoply spins up an Amazon Redshift database instance for its users. 

- We familiarize ourselves with data warehousing without committing to anyone just yet.
- We get a managed warehouse for our clients.
- We can sell data warehousing to clients so that they don’t need to work on it themselves.
- With centralized data we can start exploring advanced data (or customer) modeling.
- We can charge more for analytics as a unit because of the added warehouse management.

The highest tier before custom pricing is $750 per month.

## Proof of Concept

> Your proof of concept can be more or less technical. It’s up to you if you want to go into the weeds and details of the solution you’re presenting. However, the most important factor is that **it MUST work**. In other words, although there are always bumpy roads ahead, the solution should work at least in its most elementary, barebones stage. We don’t want to pitch ideas that we can’t backup to clients. We don’t want to assume something’s going to work just to discover it doesn’t after we and the client have committed to it.

## Closing Remarks

> Here you can add any details, notes, and gotchas that you think the reader should be aware of. Write about things like edge cases, potential problems in the future, hiccups you stumbled upon when doing the proof of concept, and more.

- Pricing might be steep for custom integrations.
- I haven’t used Panoply before.
- I couldn’t see an integration with Heap Analytics.
- There is an integration with Mode Analytics.
- The day we manage to solve data warehousing on our, we can skip Panoply.
